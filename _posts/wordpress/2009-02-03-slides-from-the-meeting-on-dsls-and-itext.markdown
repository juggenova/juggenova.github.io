Here you are the slides from the very interesting presentations that Alessio and Massimo gave at the last meeting. Alessio introduced LISP and LISP support on the JVM with ABCL, then explained how to use it to quickly create DSLs. Code samples are available at http://juggenova.net/code-samples/ Massimo gave a tutorial on iText, a very powerful and flexible library for the generation of PDF and HTML documents. http://docs.google.com/Present?docid=dcbfhm98_75gcvm7qg3 Share this: Facebook X Like Loading...
