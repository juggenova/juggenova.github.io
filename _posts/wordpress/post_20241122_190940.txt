Titolo: JUG meeting su “DCI – Data, Context and Interaction”
URL: https://juggenova.wordpress.com/2011/04/18/jug-meeting-su-dci-data-context-and-interaction/
Contenuto: La prossima riunione del JUG Genova si terrà Mercoledì 20 Aprile 2011, alle 18:30 in ManyDesigns. L’indirizzo è Via G. D’Annunzio 2/51 (piano 12, usando l’ascensore A). Fabrizio Giudici presenterà “DCI – Data, Context and Interaction” DCI – Data, Context and Interaction – è una best practice OO introdotta recentemente da Trygve Reenskaug, il formalizzatore del pattern MVC. DCI, da certi punti di vista, può essere visto come un’evoluzione del MVC, predicando un modo per distribuire correttamente ruoli e responsabilità in un’applicazione ad oggetti che interagisce significativamente con il mondo esterno. Tuttavia, DCI è un concetto ancora più sofisticato, in quanto coinvolge profondamente alcune best-practice di OOD e invita a ripensare il design degli oggetti. Fabrizio introdurrà DCI con alcuni semplici esempi di codice Java, proponendo la sua personale “best-practice” di implementazione di DCI. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trygve_Reenskaug Per registrarsi all’evento: http://www.jugevents.org/jugevents/event/show.html?id=37238 Per seguire la lista di discussione: http://groups.google.com/group/jug-genova Share this: Facebook X Like Loading...

Titolo: Genova JUG Meeting @ NIS on elements web library and Javaday 2010 – 02/02/2010
URL: https://juggenova.wordpress.com/2010/01/19/genova-jug-meeting-nis-on-elements-web-library-and-javaday-2010-02022010/
Contenuto: The next meeting of the Genova JUG will take place at 6.30pm on the 2nd of February 2010 at the new location of NIS in Via al Porto Antico 7, 16128 Genova We’ll talk about: Elements web component library (Giampiero Granatella, Paolo Predonzani) report from Javaday Roma 2010 (Carlo Bonamico) Elements is an open source library of web UI components for high productivity in small to large projects. It is not “yet another framework” competing in the framework arena; rather, it is a library that integrates with regular JSP’s, with Struts 2 and, in future developments, with other frameworks. The components cover all levels of abstraction: low (single fields), medium (forms) and high (multi-page wizards, integrations with JFreeChart and GoogleMaps, etc.). Elements does not require any xml configuration but uses reflection and annotations to interact with regular pojo’s. This JUG presentation will show how to create a feature-rich multi-page form (see the picture below) in 15 minutes. Participation is free and open to all; if you plan to attend, please register on http://www.jugevents.org/jugevents/event/22798.

Per approfondire la conoscenza di GWT può essere molto utile la “Reference Card” di dzone.com, una specie di “Bignami” che sintetizza i principali concetti e costrutti di una tecnologia in un formato molto pratico da consultare: http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/gwt-style-configuration-and-js Sul sito di dzone.com, previa registrazione free, è possibile scaricare anche reference cards su Ajax, Flex, Rails, jQuery, GlassFish, Spring, Silverlight, Idea, Design Patterns, EJB3, Eclipse… e nuove card sono aggiunte ogni mese. Il prossimo meeting si terrà martedi’ 16 settembre 2008. Location e argomenti verranno confermati a breve sul sito e sulla mailing list. Share this: Facebook X Like Loading...

Titolo: Demo di browser multimodale al prossimo JUG meeting il 15/07/2008
URL: https://juggenova.wordpress.com/2008/07/08/demo-di-browser-multimodale-al-prossimo-jug-meeting-il-15072008/
Contenuto: Cosa succede se si mettono insieme NASA World Wind, un telecomando del Wii, e un paio di led a infrarossi? Giampaolo Melis lo ha fatto ed è riuscito a creare un sistema per navigare le mappe terrestri (quindi muoversi, zoomare, ruotare, ecc) semplicemente muovendo le mani davanti al monitor. Spiega Giampaolo: “Il mio programma mi permette di gestire per ora 2 punti [nello spazio]. Una delle cose interessanti e’ che dopo un po’ che lo usi ti viene naturale. E’ un po’ come quando abbiamo imparato ad usare il mouse, subito preferisci usare la tastiera, ma dopo un po’ …” Ecco una foto dei led… … un’immagine del software Java mentre rileva la posizione di due led contemporaneamente… … e un breve video dedicato al nostro JUG (su Vimeo). Avremo il piacere di vedere una demo live di Giampaolo al prossimo incontro del JUG Genova il 15 Luglio 2008. Accorrete numerosi! Share this: Facebook X Like Loading...

Titolo: Java IDE Day: slides, screencasts and a full report are online
URL: https://juggenova.wordpress.com/2008/03/25/java-ide-day-slides-screencasts-and-a-full-report-are-online/
Contenuto: We are happy to announce that the talk slides and demo screencasts, together with a full report of the event are online on the http://www.ideday.org website. A transcript of the final panel on the future of Java IDEs, as well as a photo gallery are also available. (Per un resoconto in Italiano, vedi http://www.giampierogranatella.com/blog). When last year Fabrizio Giudici “threw” the idea of organizing a follow-up to the very successful IDE shootout organized by the Cologne JUG, we were enthusiastic at first, then we took some time to evaluate the whole thing since our JUG is quite small… even if, on paper, the Genova JUG dates back to several years ago, it had become no more than a low participation mailing list until a new group of participants brought it back to activity in the beginning of 2007. But the idea was fascinating, and so we decided to take this challenge… together with JUG Roma, which also was interested by the proposal, we invited representatives from the four major IDEs (NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, JDeveloper); everyone was very interested and supportive, although, unfortunately, Eclipse was unable to participate because it was already involved in other events (including, obviously, EclipseCon) in the same period. We decided that the event had to be less than a “confrontation” of the IDEs and more of a community event, where experts, developers and students could discuss the innovation and the future of Java development tools. I think that this idea did resonate in many places, since we received significant (and absolutely necessary) support in organizing the IDE day not only from Sun, Oracle and JetBrains, from the Faculties of Engineering of Genova and Rome Universities, but also from the Open-Lab student association and O’Reilly UK. Moreover, a number of local companies active in the Java development, traning and consulting areas were happy to support the event by offering a coffee break and, more importantly, by promoting the Java IDE Day among their employees and contacts: Eptamedia, Finsa Consulting, ManyDesigns, NIS and K-Tech. The IDE day took place in Genova on the 10th of March and in Rome the following 12th. It definitely was a success: more than 200 developers attended it overall (130 in Genova and 70 in Rome). Beside the number, a positive result has been that everyone could appreciate three very interesting speakers showing not just very high quality technical content but more significantly, a lot of collaboration between them. The talk slides and demo screencasts, together with a full report of the event are online on the http://www.ideday.org website. This report is in English and more focused on the Genova event; for more information on the Rome event you can visit Report on javaportal.it (in Italian). For a first-hand report in Italian see http://www.giampierogranatella.com/blog. A transcript of the final panel on the future of Java IDEs, as well as a photo gallery are also available. A big thank you again to all people and organizations who made the IDE Day a success, and particularly to Paolo, Angelo, Alessandro, Giampiero, Corrado A, Corrado L, Fabio, Fabrizio, Mara, Giorgio, and Carlo.
