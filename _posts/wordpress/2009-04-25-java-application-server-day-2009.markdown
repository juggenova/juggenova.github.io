Following the success of last year Java IDE Day, the entire JUG staff is happy to announce a new special community event: the Java Application Server Day 2009! The last six months have seen big news on the application server front, including substantially new releases of most major app servers (both commercial and open source), and, last week, news about the Oracle-Sun merger. We hope it will be both interesting and exciting to hear about the technical innovations directly from the evangelists and members of the development teams of four well-known application servers: JBoss, Glassfish, Spring dm Server, Oracle/Weblogic. Speakers will include Alexis Moussine-Pouchkine (Sun GlassFish), Paolo Ramasso (Oracle Fusion Middleware), Alessio Soldano (RedHat JBoss) & Alef Arendsen (Spring dm Server), who will compare the most innovative features of theri respective server platforms. The Application Server Day 2009 will take place thursday May 21st 2009, 14.30-18.30 in room B1, Faculty of Engineering, University of Genova, Via Opera Pia 13, Genova, Italy (same location as the IDE Day) Participation is free and open to all, but we kindly ask you to register on the http://www.serverday.org website, where you can also find all practical information about the event. Please help us to promote the Application Server Day by publishing the news on your blog/newsletter/site.
