The recent NetBeans Demo Camp special meeting was definitely a success! We had an higher than usual attendance, with several new faces. Again, we thank NIS for hosting the meeting… Giampaolo Melis on JavaFX Fabrizio Giudici on NetBeans 6.5 Everyone enjoyed Fabrizio’s presentation on the latest NetBeans 6.5 features (hibernate support, JavaScript debugging, incremental compilation, and more), and Giampaolo presentation and demo on the integration of Java FX and Java. Giampaolo presented several hybrid applications where a JavaFX GUI enriches a Java application logic. The topics for the next meeting, which will take place on the 20th January 2008 will be announced shortly… stay tuned!
