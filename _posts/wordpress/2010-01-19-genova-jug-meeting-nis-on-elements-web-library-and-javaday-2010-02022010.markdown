The next meeting of the Genova JUG will take place at 6.30pm on the 2nd of February 2010 at the new location of NIS in Via al Porto Antico 7, 16128 Genova We’ll talk about: Elements web component library (Giampiero Granatella, Paolo Predonzani) report from Javaday Roma 2010 (Carlo Bonamico) Elements is an open source library of web UI components for high productivity in small to large projects. It is not “yet another framework” competing in the framework arena; rather, it is a library that integrates with regular JSP’s, with Struts 2 and, in future developments, with other frameworks. The components cover all levels of abstraction: low (single fields), medium (forms) and high (multi-page wizards, integrations with JFreeChart and GoogleMaps, etc.). Elements does not require any xml configuration but uses reflection and annotations to interact with regular pojo’s. This JUG presentation will show how to create a feature-rich multi-page form (see the picture below) in 15 minutes.
