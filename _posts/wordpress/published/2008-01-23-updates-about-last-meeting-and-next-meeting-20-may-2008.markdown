Yesterday Gianpiero and Corrado gave us two very interesting presentations on JSF and Struts2, discussing similarities and differences. The slides will be posted soon on the website. 

The next meeting will be on the 20th of may 2008; in the meantime, there should be a special event in March, but we will announce it as soon as we can get confirmation for the details.
