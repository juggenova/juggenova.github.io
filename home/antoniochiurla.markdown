Software Developer, Java enthusiast.

Ciao, I'm Antonio Chiurla. 
I'm a software consultant working with several programming languages.

My first Java project dates back to 1995 when I realized an applet.
In the last twenty years I have implemented some protocols for file transfer and related software components.

My great ability to create bugs has made me good at troubleshooting and
the poor performance of my old computers has made me good at improving software performance.

I'm a curious person and I always want to discover ever some new feature.
