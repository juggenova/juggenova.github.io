Software Developer, Java enthusiast.

Ciao, I'm Antonio Chiurla. 
I'm a software consultant working with several programming languages.

My first Java project dates back to 1995 to develop an applet.
Last years I have implemented some protocols for file transfer and related software components.

My great ability to realize bugs has made me good at troubleshooting.
The poor performance of my computers has made me good at improving software performance.

I'm curious and I want to discover ever some new feature.

I made my passion my work. (Cit.: M.C.)
